This is the code repository associated with the paper: Huggins et al. (2023). Overlooked risks and opportunities in groundwatersheds of the world’s protected areas. *Nature Sustainability*, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01086-9

**Repository structure**:
- [datasources.md](https://github.com/XanderHuggins/groundwatersheds-for-PAs/blob/main/datasources.md) : documentation and web-links to all data used in this study.
- /scripts : this folder contains scripts used in data preprocessing and analysis. The numbers in each script indicate the sequence the scripts need to be executed in (i.e., a script with the number 2 requires output from a script(s) within the same folder with the number 1). Analysis scripts require output from the full set of preprocessing scripts. The figure below overviews the script repository structure and dependence between scripts.

Additional scripts, such as plotting scripts, can me made available upon request.
